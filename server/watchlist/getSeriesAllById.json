        "Overview": "The pressures of fatherhood threaten to bring Dexter's world crashing down. In his carelessness, Dexter realizes that he's misplaced crucial evidence, something that could expose his dark side to the world. But his search will have to wait, as Miami Metro's two simultaneous murder cases continue to escalate. Their top priority is to solve 'The Vacation Murders', a series of robberies gone bad that threaten Miami's lucrative tourist industry. Lundy, however, remains convinced that the bigger problem is dealing with the Trinity Killer, who unbeknownst to them is already stalking his next victim. Dexter has to weave a web of lies to extract himself from his duties, hoping to bury his secret before someone else finds it first.",
